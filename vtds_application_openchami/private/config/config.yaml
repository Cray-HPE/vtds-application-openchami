  # discovery of RedFish endpoints. A discovery network may be either a
  # Cluster Network, identified by a network name from the Cluster layer
  # configuration, or an internal network, with no network name but an
  # explicit network CIDR. Either a network CIDR or a network name must
  # be supplied. If both or neither is supplied this is an error. If a
  # given cluster does not contain the network named in a Cluster
  # Network, that network will be removed from the set of discovery
  # networks prior to deployment.

  # All of the valid networks specified here will be used for discovery
  # of RedFish endpoints when OpenCHAMI is deployed.
